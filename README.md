# mini-projects Playground 🚀

🛠️ Why just learn when you can build? Dive into the heart of each tech stack or framework directory to find a series of mini-projects. 

💻 Welcome to the MiniProjects Playground! Here, I turn learning into doing by creating hands-on mini-projects for each tech stack or framework I master.  These projects are crafted not just for coding mastery but for a deeper understanding of real-world applications.

### 🏗️ Project Showcase

Explore a curated collection of mini-projects, each residing in its dedicated directory. These projects span a diverse range of technologies, providing a holistic view of their real-world applications.

### 🛠️ Hands-On Learning

Why stop at learning when you can build? Dive into the heart of each tech stack or framework directory to discover a series of mini-projects designed for both coding mastery and a deeper understanding of practical applications. Witness the fusion of theory and practice as you navigate through the code experiments.

### 📂 Project Directory

Navigate through the repository using our Project Directory. Each directory hosts mini-projects that showcase the capabilities of a specific tech stack or framework. Pick a directory, explore the projects, and witness the magic of applied knowledge.

| Directory | Mini-Projects |
| --- | --- |
| 🚀 airflow-dataproc-etl |	Automated pipeline for data processing and analysis using Google Cloud services like Dataproc for Spark and Hive, GCS for storage and Google Composer for Airflow |
| 🌐 React	| Interactive web applications and UI magic |
|🤖 TensorFlow|	Deep learning projects for AI enthusiasts|
|⚙️ Flask	|Building web applications with Flask|
